## Extra credit
**Whew! We said itâ€™s a brain-bender. Extra credit in your lab writeup: can you find a better way of explaining this?**
We could first see the passive close in option B.

And then seeing them in a role-swap way, reverse the local and remote peer.
As it marks in red, and the right now local peer doesn't know if the last ack it sent rcved by the remote peer. So the prereq \#1 and \#2 and \#3 are satisfied but for \#4 it has to linger.
